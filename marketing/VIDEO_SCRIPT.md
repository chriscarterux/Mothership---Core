## Scene 2: Problem (0:10-0:25)

**Visual:**
- Developer at desk, overwhelmed
- Split screen: PRD doc | Code editor | Test runner | PR review
- Each quadrant multiplies, feeling chaotic

**Text Overlay:**
> "PRDs. Implementation. Tests. Reviews."
> "It's tedious."

**Voiceover:** "You spend more time on process than building."

**Text Overlay:**
> "What if there was a better way?"

**B-roll:** Frustrated typing, clock spinning, coffee refills

## Scene 3: Install (0:25-0:40)

- Clean terminal, single command typed:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriscarterux/Mothership/main/install.sh | bash
```

- Git commit appears:
```
feat(auth): implement OAuth provider configuration

Generated by Mothership Drone
```

**Text Overlay:**
> "The Drone builds."

## Scene 6: Test & Review (1:25-1:45)

**Visual:**
- Split screen:
  - Left: Probe running chaos tests
    ```
    🔬 Injecting network failure...
    🔬 Testing rate limits...
    🔬 Simulating concurrent users...
    ✓ All chaos tests passed
    ```
  - Right: Overseer reviewing
    ```
    👁️ Reviewing MOTH-001...
    ✓ Code quality: excellent
    ✓ Test coverage: 94%
    ✓ No security issues
    ⟶ Approved for merge
    ```

**Text Overlay:**
> "Tested. Reviewed. Ready to ship."

**B-roll:** Green status badges, PR merged animation
