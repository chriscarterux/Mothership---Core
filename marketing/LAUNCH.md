# 🛸 Mothership Launch Guide

## Twitter/X Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I built an AI agent system that plans, codes, tests, and reviews features automatically.

It's called Mothership. 🛸

Here's how it works (thread) 👇
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The problem with AI coding assistants:

- You still write the PRD
- You still run the tests  
- You still do code review
- You still deploy

What if AI handled ALL of it?
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
Mothership is a fleet of specialized AI agents:

🔮 Oracle - Reads your docs, creates stories
🛠️ Drone - Implements one story at a time
🔬 Probe - Writes chaos tests
👁️ Overseer - Reviews before merge

Each agent does ONE thing well.
```

### Tweet 4 (Demo)
```
Here's what it looks like:

1. "Plan user authentication"
   → Oracle creates 6 stories

2. ./mothership.sh build 20
   → Drone implements each story
   → Commits automatically

3. ./mothership.sh test
   → Probe writes edge case tests

Done. ✅
```

### Tweet 5 (Comparison)
```
Why not just use Claude/GPT?

Single AI = jack of all trades
Mothership = specialized experts

Like having a dev team instead of one generalist.

And it loops until complete. Fresh context each time.
```

### Tweet 6 (Install)
```
One-line install:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriscarterux/Mothership/main/install.sh | bash

Works with:
- Any AI tool (Claude, Cursor, GPT-4)
- Any project tracker (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues)
- New or existing codebases
```

### Tweet 7 (Credits + CTA)
```
Inspired by @GeoffreyHuntley's Ralph pattern and @ryancarson's implementation.

Mothership takes it further: planning + testing + review built in.

## LinkedIn Post

```
🛸 Just open-sourced Mothership - an AI agent orchestration system.

The problem: AI coding assistants are powerful, but you still do all the planning, testing, and reviewing yourself.

The solution: Specialized AI agents that handle the entire development cycle:

1. Oracle reads your docs and creates stories
2. Drone implements one story at a time
3. Probe writes chaos tests
4. Overseer reviews code before merge

It's like having a dev team that never sleeps.

One-line install. Works with any AI tool. MIT licensed.

Title: I built an AI agent system that plans, codes, tests, and reviews automatically

I got tired of AI assistants that help with coding but still require me to do all the planning, testing, and review.

So I built Mothership - a fleet of specialized AI agents:
- Oracle: Reads docs, creates stories
- Drone: Implements one story per iteration  
- Probe: Writes chaos tests
- Overseer: Reviews before merge

It loops until complete, fresh context each time.

Works with any AI tool (Claude, Cursor, GPT-4). MIT licensed.

Would love feedback!

Title: Mothership: Specialized AI agents for software development

Instead of one AI doing everything, Mothership uses specialized agents for each phase:

Planning → Building → Testing → Reviewing

Each agent has one job and does it well. The system loops until the feature is complete.

Inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's "Ralph" pattern, but with dedicated testing and review agents built in.

Open source, works with any LLM. Curious what the community thinks.

Title: Show HN: Mothership – AI agents that plan, build, test, and review your features

Hey HN,

I built Mothership after getting frustrated that AI coding assistants still require manual planning, testing, and review.

Mothership is a fleet of specialized AI agents:
- Oracle reads your docs and creates stories
- Drone implements one story at a time (loops until done)
- Probe writes chaos tests (edge cases, security, etc.)
- Overseer reviews code before merge

Key differences from similar tools:
- Works with any AI CLI (Claude, Cursor, GPT-4)
- Integrates with Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, or local JSON
- Planning is automated (reads your docs)
- Testing is a dedicated agent, not an afterthought

Inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph pattern. MIT licensed.

Interactive demo: [link]

Would love feedback on the approach and any pain points you'd want solved.
