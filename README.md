# 🛸 Mothership

**AI agents that build your features.**

```
"Build user authentication" → Stories created → Code written → Tests passing → Ready to merge
```

"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: plan user auth"
"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: build"
```

One 150-line prompt. Modes: plan, build, test, review.

## Full (Specialized Agents)

```bash
cp -r full/ .mothership/
```

```
"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: plan user auth"   # Oracle
"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: build"            # Drone
"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: test"             # Probe
"Read .mothership/mothership.md and run: review"           # Overseer

## What's Better Than Ralph?

[Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) is brilliant: one prompt, one loop, ship code.

Mothership keeps that simplicity and adds:

| Ralph Lacks | Mothership Has |
|-------------|----------------|
| Planning | `plan` mode/Oracle creates Linear stories |
| Testing | `test` mode/Probe writes chaos tests |
| Review | `review` mode/Overseer checks quality |
| Recovery | Checkpoint for context loss |
| Patterns | codebase.md persists learnings |

---

## How It Works

1. **State in Linear** - Stories track progress (not local JSON)
2. **One task per run** - Fresh context, focused work
3. **Checkpoint recovery** - Resume after context loss
4. **Pattern memory** - codebase.md carries learnings
